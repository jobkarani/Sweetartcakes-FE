            <h5>a story about embracing the unexpected.</h5>
            <p class="p">
                The path that led Hayley to becoming a luxury wedding cake designer began when her world fell apart in just a matter of seconds. A car accident left Hayley with severe injuries that changed her life and everything as she knew it. With the consideration of two small children to support, the accident rapidly ended her career in the operating theatre and forced her to focus not on what she had lost, but what she could gain.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                Through the trauma and injuries of her accident, Hayley rediscovered her love of baking and placed her attention on cake decorating and sugar crafting - something that had once been a beloved pastime to enjoy with her Nan growing up. With the gift of time and determination to succeed, Hayley began experimenting with flavours and creating new recipes. Without even realising, a lifelong passion for wedding cake design was established. Over nine years later, each year offers a journey for Hayley Elizabeth Cake Design, proving that her passion is unrelenting

            <p class="p">You can often find Hayley working from her garden studio crafting elaborate sugar flower forms or indulging in her other passion, interior design. When she’s not creating extraordinary masterpieces for weddings, Hayley loves nothing more than spending time with her husband, two children (D’Arcy and Harrison) and Dexter, the beagle.</p>
            <p class="p">Before Hayley's journey to becoming a wedding cake designer, she was a medic in the Army, which immersed her into an exhilarating and endlessly exciting world. Hayley’s determination, resilience and grit have led her to where she is today, establishing herself as a luxury wedding cake designer and becoming distinguished within the industry for her exceptional sugar flower and wafer paper skills.</p>

            <p class="p">Hayley's warm, genuine and personal approach promises impeccable service without compromising on luxury. From the moment you arrive at your cake tasting consultation, you will feel like you have known each other forever. The beginning of an experience that you will never forget.</p>
            <p class="p">Hayley's devotion to exercise began after her car accident, filling her free time with running to fuel a positive mindset. With the New Forest on her doorstep, she is often racking up the miles with her dog, Dexter. With an unrelenting love for coffee and an adoration for all things pink, if you could find Hayley anywhere in the world, it would be soaking up the scenery on a Cornish coastline while sipping a glass of champagne – the ultimate luxury.</p>
